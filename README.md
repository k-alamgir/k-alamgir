# ðŸ‘‹ Hi

I have an academic background in economics and growing experience in applied research. Iâ€™m eager to contribute to projects that use data to understand social and economic challenges. While I am still developing my technical skills, Iâ€™m motivated to support meaningful research in academic and policy settings.
<!---I am particularly interested in development economics, behavioral science, and financial risk. I seek research opportunities where I can apply empirical tools to address complex policy questions. In the long term, I hope to contribute to impactful research in both academic and policy settings.--->
